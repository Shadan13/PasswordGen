Generates an 8-character (alphanumeric) password using the Random library in Python. Was used for a project involving developing a digital smart door lock connected to IoT.

This project was initially done on Replit and I'm not enitrely sure if it will work with Github so in the event that it doesn't work please head to https://replit.com/@floutdoubt/phy#main.py thanks :)
